# Description

Some of us in [Unify][Unify homepage] attended Linux Device Drivers training,
held in our development department in [Brno][Wikipedia: Brno] starting on
25th and ending on 29th November 2013.

Our trainer for the week was [Anton Arapov][Anton Arapov at G+] from
[RedHat][Wikipedia: RedHat].

During the week long session we experimented with connecting [Wii
Nunchuck][Wikipedia: Wii Remote -- Nunchuk] to [Raspberry Pi][Wikipedia:
Raspberry Pi] and also with its UART.

This repository contains my own solutions.

Only after publishing the repository I noticed that commit times and dates are
off. This was due to unsychronized time on the virtual machine I used during
the session.

# Description

Some of us in [Unify][Unify homepage] attended Linux Device Drivers training,
held in our development department in [Brno][Wikipedia: Brno] in days between
*25th and 29th November 2013*.

Our trainer for the week was [Anton Arapov][Anton Arapov at G+] from
[RedHat][Wikipedia: RedHat].

During the week long session we experimented with connecting [Wii Nunchuck][
Wikipedia: Wii] to [Raspberry Pi][Wikipedia: Raspberry Pi] and also with its
UART.

This repository contains my own solutions.

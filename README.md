# Description

Some of us in [Unify][Unify homepage] attended Linux Device Drivers training,
held in our development department in [Brno][Wikipedia: Brno] in days between
*25th and 29th November 2013*.

During the week we experimented with connecting [Wii Nunchuck][Wikipedia: Wii]
to [Raspberry Pi][Wikipedia: Raspberry Pi] and also with its UART.

This repository contains my solutions.
